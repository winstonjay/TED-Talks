, you might 202
, i went 202
, these are 202
, it will 202
when we & 202
now we & 201
is that you 201
how many of 201
so much . 201
; t believe 201
for a long 201
at that time 201
; re actually 201
, so the 200
the center of 200
when they & 200
middle of the 200
talk about the 200
and when we 200
on it . 200
every day , 199
that it is 199

were going to 199
time , i 199
, and yet 199
, i am 199

, but he 199
what are the 199
going to make 198

going to tell 198

people don & 198
that in the 198
when it & 198
. why ? 198

, it can 198
of life , 198
<NUM> percent , 197
this isn & 197
in the end 197
and what & 197
at a time 197
; and that 197
, i started 197
figure out what 197
is what i 197
; and so 197
i say , 197
; s time 197
people who have 197
some kind of 196
. what you 196
was one of 196
, and for 196
that . so 196
, where you 196
for the last 196
, we will 196
a matter of 196
that , we 196
is that they 196
it in a 196
; and & 196
to find out 195
do it , 195
, say , 195
talk to you 195
something like this 195
that time , 195
, where i 195
you . i 194
would have been 194
the other hand 194
you , and 194
the same . 194
the brain . 194
so what i 194
lot of the 194
, what do 194
where we & 194
i used to 194
; ve just 193
question is , 193
of them are 193
, i could 193
t know how 193
; t actually 193
and then it 193
take a look 193
<NUM> billion dollars 193
so you & 192
and there was 192
as long as 192
out how to 192
i like to 192
, really , 192
the internet , 192
an example of 192
here . and 191
it is not 191
<NUM> and <NUM> 191

that , in 190
so , this 190
a & quot 190
all of a 190
of a sudden 190
what it & 189

you think of 129
- - when 129
. many of 129
out of it 129

look at that 129
there - - 129
so , if 129
, and by 129
i was the 129
as we & 129
s the same 129
them . but 129
was trying to 129
about how to 129

as & quot 129
me , it 129
tens of thousands 129
trying to figure 129

to happen . 127
in the west 127
? we & 127
for a while 127
a very simple 127
, but as 127
a two - 127

and as we 127
can make a 127
what i did 127
; i was 127
go to a 127

i won & 126
the whole thing 126

o & # 126
millions of people 126

a result , 125
now this is 125
most of you 125

this is our 102
the time i 102
is to be 102
what does it 102
it & quot 102
many of these 102
, and therefore 102
do with the 102
, not a 102
that we will 102
actually , i 102
the mid - 102
so i had 102
that the world 102
out to the 102
and in that 102
? i don 102
something that i 102
the point is 102
; but i 102
show you what 102
you do ? 102

is all about 101
a lot to 101
time . we 101
because you can 101
. the last 101
a different way 101
a high - 101
; s even 101
to do in 101
of you may 101
some of our 101
we couldn & 101

ain & # 101
time . but 101
so many people 101
is what you 101
to do so 101
or not . 101
for example . 101
turned out to 101
with us . 101
quot ; then 101
quot ; here 101
going to use 101
the context of 101
of the story 101
to do things 101
down . and 101
nothing to do 101
when they were 100
things that you 100
i came to 100
the most powerful 100
; s already 100
is a picture 100
know that the 100
to go through 100
a few days 100
you . it 100
my god , 100
, what if 100
what does that 100
world . but 100
in the field 100
<NUM> minutes , 100
for people to 100
on in the 100
the next generation 100
friend of mine 100
so that the 100
other side of 100
a very different 100
, just as 100
with that . 100
is . and 100
school , and 100
is , how 100
of the best 100
- - she 100
trying to make 100
you know how 100
now we have 100
s got to 100
, which , 100
, what does 100
a child , 100
re looking for 100
world , but 100
every time i 100
do ? & 100
, how to 100
open - source 100
so the question 100
want to take 100
to have an 100
course , we 100
some of those 100
me , because 100
. and again 100
what happens is 99
going to come 99
it was in 99
, if the 99
the beginning , 99
. also , 99
them , but 99
most importantly , 99
need to get 99
it can & 99
but - - 99
so i can 99
quot ; wow 99
we found that 99
the sun , 99
to the right 99
it should be 99
so these are 99
way in which 99
for the past 99
is the only 99
the reason i 99
it feels like 99
. for me 99
in which the 99
course , is 99
because they were 99
at it . 99
we call it 99
think , is 99
less than <NUM> 99
to get it 99
a sudden , 99
for them , 99
as a child 99
problem is that 99
t even know 99
; s done 99
. . and 99
, so this 99
, in terms 99
, but actually 98
we do , 98
for a few 98
s also a 98
- i don 98
of them is 98
period of time 98
million years ago 98
so what do 98
me , but 98
up with the 98
<NUM> . it 98
around us . 98
if that & 98
what i think 98
little bit . 98
s why we 98
over time . 98
, <NUM> million 98
but when i 98
go into the 98
m just going 98
. okay ? 98
i knew that 98
than that , 98
a very good 98
no , it 98
the environment . 98
we have . 98
the ocean , 98
it ? & 98
on the top 98
kind of thing 98
in there . 98
. but how 97

we weren & 83
i learned that 83
thinking about the 83
i ’ m 83
can see how 83
were in the 83
they can do 83
the point where 83
. because if 83
it . in 83
that when we 83
s really important 83
past <NUM> years 83
know what you 83
spend a lot 83
that it can 83
. i found 83
and - a 83
<NUM> . we 83
lot of things 83
you would have 83
wanted to know 83
(laughter) and so 83
somebody & # 83
made up of 83
that what we 83
. and once 83
to change . 83
no idea what 83

what we know 83
again , i 83
to the united 83
, we didn 83
me . (laughter) 83
<NUM> . the 83

of what the 82
; re living 82
, including the 82
months ago , 82
to be there 82
focus on the 82
is where we 82
what happened to 82
. now what 82
the other , 82
work . so 82
is what & 82
they do . 82
that one of 82
the design of 82
do this ? 82
i would be 82
but i also 82
that i am 82
like you to 82
is what the 82
than any other 82
m not a 82
a whole lot 82
the value of 82

on the bottom 79
when you see 79

than <NUM> years 79
but there was 79
really hard to 79

so what is 79
something about it 79
kind of the 79
a - half 79
in ways that 79
it was about 79
to be part 79
years . i 79
; t hear 79
this as a 79
. like , 79
; t realize 79
from all over 79
even though it 79
i was there 79
we really need 79
look like this 79
to put it 79
; re always 79
so they can 79
, three , 79
what you want 79

go back and 79
is it & 79
a great deal 79

: yes . 79
of about <NUM> 79
will tell you 78
the question of 78

is the way 78
what we were 78
, according to 78
, i knew 78
and a little 78
i think what 78

, not to 78
a team of 78
technology , and 78
because i had 78
up there . 78
t know about 78

very well . 75
with all of 75
i showed you 75
the sky . 75
we are now 75
s a bit 75
the equivalent of 75
right here . 75
human beings , 75
<NUM> , there 75
be one of 75
the ones who 75
. she had 75
d have to 75
s not enough 75
, we did 75
just like the 75

see on the 75
the top . 75
us , we 75
, how we 75
it really is 75
and they will 75
the people . 75
can be done 75
this would be 75
they were able 75
this . (laughter) 75
to all the 75
those who are 75

, what happens 74
there is one 74
. (laughter) there 74
or you & 74
in that moment 74
what you have 74
the number one 74
he was the 74
sort of , 74

, out of 74
couple of weeks 74
but it doesn 74
this ? well 74
if you ask 74
. but my 74

re working on 74

there were <NUM> 74
at least , 74
s start with 74
there is something 74
and we did 74
s it . 74
in the year 74
we can have 74
any of the 74
world . this 74

there isn & 74
, with all 74
with , and 74
we did was 74
we can change 74
on . but 74
was in a 74
s the most 74
of me . 74
change . and 74
the truth . 74
since i was 74
. why do 74
the street . 74
you could do 74
next time you 74
a moment , 74
to get there 74
you need a 74
of our own 74
. so she 74
the last year 74
for the world 74
most of my 74
here , the 74
s a real 74
school , i 74
us , but 74
to tell the 74
the data , 74
means is that 74
know that we 74

i thought it 74
the life of 74
ve come to 74
when you do 73
a second , 73
on and on 73
and i also 73
there . the 73
and many of 73
and think about 73
. they would 73
s happening in 73
one on the 73
way to do 73
them , they 73
is sort of 73
which i think 73
call it the 73
right ? but 73
which you can 73
the front of 73
, if there 73
one or two 73
is very important 73
ago , the 73
; s and 73
i was , 73
if you like 73
and they don 73
most of our 73
so again , 73
us . the 73
. can we 73
in life . 73
day - - 73
, oh , 73

as a way 73
what i can 73
is a new 73
, she said 73
<NUM> a . 73
in my head 73
; s face 73
and we will 73
to get them 73
if you get 73
there are so 73
it was my 73

; re building 73
came to the 73
. it may 73
and then she 73
was talking about 73
and instead of 73
- (laughter) and 73
the door , 73
know that there 73
and so when 73
so i did 73
re doing . 73
we believe that 73
. and why 73
etc . , 73
decision - making 73
put them in 73
them . the 73
before . and 73
a story . 73
actually , the 73
have to look 73
, why don 73
so you see 73
the vast majority 73
here at ted 73
of trying to 73
, so there 73
that i wanted 73
there were no 73
hours a day 73
<NUM> percent in 73
♫ ♫ you 73
a problem , 73
i have the 73
, they said 73
so , there 73
percent of their 72
, or at 72
- hand side 72
to come out 72
but also , 72
, to see 72
and then when 72
more important than 72
a really good 72
- - people 72
if we had 72
the reason is 72
that in a 72
right ? (laughter) 72
people , but 72
sort of thing 72
to get rid 72
, think about 72
use it to 72
the time that 72
or you can 72
in the most 72
spent a lot 72
millions of years 72
- - maybe 72
things like this 72
at home . 72

which is very 72
we have been 72
give them a 72
that we want 72
; t there 72
do is we 72
that is to 72
s what the 72
can start to 72
if i were 72
go to school 72
the evolution of 72
, actually . 72
a moment . 72
. indeed , 72
the more i 72
other & # 72
here . we 72
, the question 72
; t seen 72
the reason for 72

a world that 72
right . and 72
in some cases 72
should be able 72
me and said 72
work . i 72
to know how 72
would love to 72
that means is 72
on the front 72
way , the 72

t even have 71
a $ <NUM> 71
these days , 71

is a place 54
just a couple 54
, the problem 54
probably the most 54
more than half 54
you live in 54
s the kind 54
about this ? 54
and what was 54
and it wasn 54
no one & 54
now , because 54
t do this 54
does it mean 54
the future is 54
it comes from 54
, where people 54
, especially when 54
down on the 54
your body , 54
is a kind 54
what i have 54
york city , 54
, though . 54
- there are 54
in the hospital 54
, which they 54
. then the 54

, most people 54
the second is 54
country - - 54
. turns out 54
to the public 54
to go in 54
is really a 54
be here . 54
was sort of 54
. in one 54
; t about 54
night , and 54
and one day 54
the question : 54
i love you 54
the next step 54
so now i 54
, in all 54
and we also 54
it from the 54
a big problem 54
t be able 54
my father was 54
; i mean 54
was looking for 54
give you the 54
to be one 54
we got to 54
thing in the 54
need to find 54
so in this 54
, that will 54
the way of 54
we did , 54
; s try 54
working on this 54
like it & 54
. (applause) but 54
around . and 54
<NUM> months , 54
very long time 54

all of it 54
, one thing 54
they should be 54
them into the 54

but more importantly 54
, today , 54
low - income 54

ca : but 54
(laughter) ca : 54
really have to 54
really don & 54
that people have 54

high school . 54
they would be 54
can see what 54
use it . 54
of the 20th 54
growing up , 54
and so he 54
. because what 54
, indeed , 54
they tend to 54
environment , and 54

, and other 54
show you , 54
the notion of 54
; how can 54

a car , 53
just can & 53
them . this 53
; m telling 53
, but no 53
, why not 53
i love that 53
; s different 53
the potential to 53

two of them 53
not at all 53
that has a 53
able to take 53
nature & # 53
to life . 53
to other people 53
in your own 53

the so - 53
the long - 53
that you need 53
the more we 53
and now it 53
come from ? 53
which is not 53
one is a 53
so what happens 53
like me . 53
these people , 53
( laughs ) 53
changed my life 53
my wife , 53
, the better 53
different ways . 53
less than one 53
, high - 53

. maybe it 53
and even though 53
you a story 53
: i was 53

fall in love 53

people who had 53
your brain . 53
. it seems 53
about how the 53
works . and 53
all the different 53
like i said 53
at this time 53
the color of 53
. imagine that 53
the best thing 53
what we really 53
on the road 53
work on the 53
give us a 53
that when i 53
you are going 53
. i still 53
when i came 53
they go to 53
in a country 53

right here , 53
only that , 53
. this means 53
the more you 53

have been able 53
<NUM> billion people 53
has always been 53

; so what 53
a scientist , 53
came out , 53
for years , 53
well - - 53
of a human 53
: you can 53
need to understand 53
we began to 53
s a story 53
we start to 53
that in <NUM> 53
over again , 53
, and an 53
of view . 53
could do it 53
something like a 53
we take a 53
in this picture 53
; s day 53
; t all 53
to help the 53
people . & 53
we know the 53
, which will 53
, have a 53
get to see 53
, looking for 53

now , for 53
then they & 53
they will be 53

the sea . 53
very similar to 53
i would love 53
. then they 53
; s here 53
that time . 53
; ve used 53
low - cost 53

. ( audio 53
( audio ) 53
four or five 53
. i . 53
. and today 53
us . they 53
about <NUM> , 53
. then there 53
what is going 53
the best of 53
per year . 53
the way down 53
but on the 53
know is that 53
but anyway , 53
finally , i 53
i came back 53
a person who 53
on the earth 53
- again , 53
to buy a 53
in a certain 53
. dh : 53

again . & 52
there may be 52
, after a 52
no , you 52
said - - 52

. so far 52
thinking about how 52
was asked to 52

about some of 52

there , it 52
. we take 52
i did it 52
that we actually 52

ok . so 52
growing up in 52
wanted to get 52

about & quot 52
what i found 52
something like <NUM> 52
as we go 52

- oh , 52
; s often 52
, and another 52
the bad news 52
as it was 52
you want , 52

? why do 52
in history , 52
, and each 52

. i guess 52
way to go 52
s the one 52
in the community 52
i guess , 52
from the sun 52
; is a 52
we put it 52
in spite of 52

them up , 52
; t pay 52

people who don 51
we find that 51
seen before . 51
s very difficult 51
not only do 51
even if it 51
a minute , 51
so we are 51
sometimes it & 51
so there was 51

if we go 51

and therefore , 50
then , when 50
but he & 50
these people are 50

other things that 50
i could see 50

well , maybe 50
s one thing 50
allow you to 50
and then this 50
if you give 50
listen to the 50
supposed to do 50
history . and 50
and the rest 50
is this ? 50
two to three 50
some of that 50
, but all 50
to be at 50

in the north 49
do so . 49
up here . 49
to be so 49
to get you 49

people , we 46
i had just 46
t exist . 46
i believe it 46
a question . 46
that , then 46
they look like 46
t know it 46
not allowed to 46
as if they 46
internet , and 46
; t put 46
so we don 46
we have today 46
is so important 46
we made a 46
, we saw 46
i see a 46
; that is 46
, and everybody 46
lot of my 46
a project that 46
more about the 46

and for that 46
, the u 46
the first to 46
see , there 46
of a second 46
the world who 46
of a very 46
that you know 46
problems . and 46
i was walking 46

that can & 45
a function of 45
a few more 45
problem . i 45
with a new 45
be in a 45
now . but 45
very much for 45
course , they 45
will have to 45
a process of 45
this planet , 45
. they did 45
. what the 45
in touch with 45
i feel that 45
, how did 45
there is another 45
. <NUM> , 45
, but even 45
to give me 45

and that they 45
had a little 45
so many other 45
on behalf of 45
this room . 45
look at me 45
a place called 45

a very powerful 45
s life . 45
. even the 45
: what & 45
the next two 45
, to help 45
; m asking 45

; d see 45
, he has 45
how do they 45
to take on 45
would you do 45
we have some 45
can create a 45
done in the 45
s like to 45
here , it 45
all going to 45
that we get 45
; m glad 45
as possible , 45
to give the 45
energy , and 45
was the best 45
the thing about 45
and i began 45
s based on 45
t think of 45
the book . 45
<NUM> ; and 45
, the very 45
in which i 45
, it gets 45
one day i 45
actually , we 45
the lab . 45
have the opportunity 45
. sometimes , 45
of light , 45
it hasn & 45
s not so 45
? here & 45
human being , 45
the problems of 45
the idea . 45
know . so 45
heart disease , 45
could be used 45
s say , 45
like , and 45
, in one 45
is because of 45
, the government 45
get a little 45
of the game 45
. i always 45
, while the 45
the truth , 45
so that when 45
a range of 45
when we get 45
? we can 45
<NUM> days , 45
know that , 45
so as a 45
is <NUM> years 45
said . & 45
i talked to 45
everyone in the 45
us is that 45
in relation to 45
. (laughter) ca 45
can actually see 45
are a few 45
you an idea 45
. com , 45
things . this 45
and so if 45
high - speed 45
, that he 45
they might be 45
s <NUM> percent 45
in my view 45
together - - 45
about the fact 45
to design a 45
a situation where 45
. narrator : 45
are kind of 45
all of their 45
of the next 45
ve been trying 45
to be as 45
<NUM> people in 45
t think i 45
company , and 45
have a new 45
in many cases 45
<NUM> times the 45
. similarly , 45
the wall . 45
is , why 45
the realm of 45
that is going 45
and the best 45
of the system 45
and in some 45
. remember , 45
; ve looked 45
; t done 45
it so that 45
to build this 45
. kb : 45
♫ ♫ the 45
as a kind 45
we ’ re 45
be true . 44
in your head 44
again , a 44
but how do 44
the globe , 44
, which he 44
it was called 44
a six - 44
talk , and 44
i talk to 44
about what you 44
, i wasn 44
thing . we 44
(laughter) and we 44
said , well 44
know that . 44
to get us 44
one that & 44
and <NUM> . 44
the people i 44
there , that 44
of you here 44
on and so 44
, the brain 44
look at your 44
found that the 44
right next to 44
did you do 44
we would be 44
old . i 44
four - year 44
looking for the 44
ve had to 44
, you must 44
i do this 44
that i should 44

who are in 44
people . they 44
of poverty . 44
going to end 44
there are also 44
family . and 44
problem . we 44
going , & 44
problems that we 44
also need to 44
do what we 44

tend to think 44
we get the 44
; re dealing 44
. so every 44
give it to 44
be , and 44
get me wrong 44
one in the 44
. so today 44
re living in 44
science , and 44
that people can 44
; 80s , 44
see , this 44
. but after 44
are supposed to 44
is a wonderful 44
to learn about 44

but these are 44
can see from 44
; re finding 44

. take the 44
of what is 44
you can start 44
all - - 44
time , there 44
soon as i 44
of the house 44
the last three 44
time that i 44
what i thought 44
something , and 44
into something that 44
; re both 44
s think about 44
more - - 44
day of the 44
one by one 44
the world with 44

we are able 44
whether they & 44
we could use 44
to make us 44
re seeing here 44
is something we 44
day . we 44
and we wanted 44
s good for 44
a job , 44
this is me 44
, where a 44
back on the 44
, and finally 44
questions , and 44
though , is 44

in short , 44
when they are 44

to get on 40
. but some 40
, i told 40
put it back 40
the story that 40
, whatever . 40
, for some 40
so here are 40
that you had 40
going through the 40
out all the 40
anything else . 40
t have access 40
have to remember 40
a city , 40
; when you 40
want to end 40
think that there 40
we did that 40
. after the 40
most people , 40
; you are 40
we continue to 40
- - really 40
would be able 40
; s starting 40
i realize that 40
they came to 40
billion years ago 40
; s taken 40
- - most 40
more recently , 40
how could we 40
of the kind 40
this story . 40
. the key 40
used to think 40
time . they 40
they did not 40
. the new 40
is you & 40
well , a 40
the image of 40
, when people 40
but we were 40
say , it 40
wanted to say 40
put on the 40
really interested in 40
couple of things 40
s happening . 40
closer to the 40
. i looked 40
figure it out 40
child , and 40
this is like 40
( cheers ) 40
would go to 40
about you , 40
moment , i 40
a cell phone 40
another thing that 40
told you that 40
reason why we 40
will have a 40
it was one 40
into the water 40
over the country 40
to the brain 40
a very big 40
it is for 40
not alone . 40
of a <NUM> 40
of the women 40
this <NUM> - 40
one , i 40
, and use 40
to know where 40
not . i 40
energy . and 40
that , so 40
the audience . 40
? so this 40
and make a 40
and you just 40
to ask the 40
we need . 40
is great . 40
because when we 40
good enough . 40
and turn it 40
the result is 40
have it . 40
million years . 40
the point that 40
world , you 40
s amazing . 40
. i should 40
and from the 40
, or any 40
such thing as 40
of <NUM> billion 40
we created a 40
black and white 40
on me . 40
. my mom 40
and this , 40
something else , 40
<NUM> ; worth 40
it does , 40
around the country 40
i would do 40
, they make 40
in this . 40
i do think 40
things , we 40
, and try 40
. because you 40
it sort of 40
s about a 40
together , they 40
because she & 40
, they may 40
others . and 40
other end of 40
it all . 40
did . i 40
decided that i 40
i will tell 40
in - law 40
and in particular 40
; re willing 40
but all of 40
. twenty - 40
; s beautiful 40
; i will 40
have a choice 40
not trying to 40
; s house 40
changes in the 40
want to understand 40
we could actually 40
. it should 40
; re born 40
in the global 40
and because we 40
that is in 40
in about <NUM> 40
because we had 40
out the window 40
t wait to 40
building , and 40
. even in 40
his life , 40
: what are 40
that make up 40
case , it 40
front of us 40
; s incredible 40
; re creating 40
never seen before 40
things we can 40
we use the 40
, from <NUM> 40
my country , 40
; s rights 40
the question i 40
tell the difference 40
you weren & 40
. after a 40
and more . 40
from all the 40
to measure the 40
reality is that 40
change . we 40
and people are 40
a country that 40
. but look 40
. so some 40
talking to you 40
where people are 40
seven years ago 40
down to a 40
not be able 40
. and another 40
together in a 40
and with a 40
in the midst 40
to me about 40
went into the 40
sitting on the 40
do something that 40
; s cool 40
want me to 40
i could make 40
a fraction of 40
now , all 40
it gives us 40

i see the 40
they had no 40
, before i 40
i took this 40
very important for 40

, going to 40
idea that the 40
to use , 40

it is possible 40
this is important 40
, and since 40
. they make 40
, one day 40
look , you 40
what we find 40
is that what 40
need to change 40

to get . 22
know how it 22
my brain , 22
and we realized 22
which - - 22

the second - 22
i also learned 22
find the right 22

. this particular 22
the truth of 22
really is . 22
my brother and 22
me to come 22
so i wrote 22
; all right 22
different countries . 22
you have heard 22
of you probably 22
life is a 22
here are a 22
the poorest countries 22
would tell me 22
that happen ? 22
s cool . 22
my dad was 22
on fire . 22
it ? what 22
unfortunately , we 22
moment , the 22
; and for 22
, my family 22
in science . 22
science . so 22
and a whole 22
of today & 22
and family . 22
that they should 22
of food , 22
the us government 22
to end . 22
our lives and 22
there are certain 22
; s minds 22
. (laughter) which 22
project , which 22
which is now 22
you put your 22
can sort of 22
? so let 22
really cool . 22
time , what 22
: so this 22
we could start 22
times faster than 22
with them and 22
but to be 22
we have of 22
we have for 22
, but so 22
of music . 22
the light that 22
. within a 22
years , in 22
go there , 22
not need to 22
of a kind 22
i had , 22
this before . 22
and on this 22
mean , how 22
. and imagine 22
tip of the 22
. when this 22
of it was 22
university , and 22
in a good 22
ve got two 22
to get involved 22
around <NUM> , 22
now there is 22
, a really 22
, and someone 22
of the number 22
you that there 22
thing that happens 22
country , the 22
be . we 22
can go on 22
the matter is 22
anything that & 22
they may have 22
you create a 22
technology & # 22
, <NUM> or 22
and ended up 22
i think our 22
so that if 22
we can still 22
whole thing . 22
but also a 22
light in the 22
was it . 22
think it will 22
. they found 22
length of the 22

this disease . 22
ago when i 22
we are and 22
, to change 22
grew up , 22
research shows that 22
a 3d printer 22
able to move 22
got it , 22
because we all 22
? what was 22
time that the 22
because one of 22
started working on 22
not the most 22
from that point 22
side - - 22
, then what 22
idea . but 22
<NUM> million tons 22
more . we 22
in a kind 22
against each other 22
the third one 22
oh , yeah 22
ve done that 22
children in the 22
instead of using 22
in this field 22

figure out which 22
so she & 22
, i moved 22

africa . i 22
it is just 22

to have something 22
was a woman 22
they knew that 22

so he can 22
. and second 22
the hubble space 22
where most of 22
a picture that 22
go around the 22
one billion people 22
billion people in 22
what they have 22
would tell you 22

can we use 22
less than five 22

that this kind 22
little bit different 22
compare it to 22
back to us 22

you would like 21
the path to 21
so really , 21
did you get 21

united states has 21
: i love 21
a big fan 21
when you talk 21

a city . 21
with that ? 21
do with our 21
to the conclusion 21
at least the 21
yet . we 21
go a little 21
those people are 21
spend the rest 21
from the point 21
of course that 21
. so of 21
it take to 21
ok . (laughter) 21
t matter , 21
was told that 21
the others . 21
and it creates 21
right kind of 21

when people are 21
means that they 21
what ? you 21
, it all 21
is only a 21
that makes the 21
any sense . 21
well it & 21
think if you 21
in collaboration with 21

what have we 21

for too long 20
a school , 20
reasons why we 20
; the other 20
do anything , 20
gave them the 20

of our brain 20
- all these 20
wide variety of 20

of ideas , 17
they were saying 17
see this in 17
question of whether 17

that problem . 17
is that not 17

by making it 13
now think about 13
i was speaking 13
my brain is 13
my guess is 13
an adult , 13
re not using 13
this has a 13
in many , 13
engine , and 13
language . i 13
her mother , 13
, which for 13
the next slide 13
from the north 13
beginning to see 13
very carefully . 13
think of ourselves 13
here and i 13
each time , 13
so once you 13
have done , 13
long ago . 13
begin to think 13
this is simply 13
it . why 13
it in terms 13
the message is 13
three of these 13
can find the 13
allow it to 13
about a decade 13
in the small 13
we hear about 13
turning it into 13

into the heart 13

the institute for 13

terms of its 13
european union , 13
with a quote 13
things going on 13
of people don 13
you take away 13
if it comes 13
; s those 13
was just about 13
actually this is 13
a bottom - 13
the early 20th 13
with a bit 13
moving into the 13
idea that if 13
we started working 13
free , and 13
about two or 13
, working together 13
t need any 13
; s cheap 13
which was that 13
you might get 13
on our side 13
with the physical 13
that time i 13
tell him that 13
one year later 13
have taught me 13
said . and 13
then i asked 13
i was wrong 13
then we started 13
imagine . i 13
and his friends 13
i made that 13
twice a day 13
was willing to 13
. he used 13
i realized how 13
, they weren 13
you just go 13
in one day 13
. due to 13
is , which 13
to the & 13
one million people 13
building . so 13
technology . this 13
come here to 13
nature , but 13
really , in 13
, because right 13
. , a 13
: i had 13
, to your 13
? a few 13
. we met 13
the lights on 13
daughter , and 13
, two weeks 13
. what should 13
; s question 13
, a bunch 13
question , what 13
would change the 13
. and given 13
, better than 13
that are much 13
more effective . 13
in the emerging 13
in new ways 13
situation where you 13
that , while 13
in non - 13
world . these 13
same thing is 13
places where the 13
. g . 13
think , because 13
of our energy 13
and the amount 13
that we already 13
make them feel 13
this . all 13
going to really 13
. and certainly 13
. now all 13
now all of 13
century . so 13
; when they 13
ve seen . 13
of action . 13
is that maybe 13
, given that 13
years , what 13
we say that 13
really isn & 13
ve got about 13
we want our 13
from the new 13
, myself , 13
the kids in 13
ways . they 13
as the one 13
training , and 13

it , for 13
united states today 13
situation where we 13
were growing up 13
terms of a 13

because , i 13

it was his 13

from the police 13

down . that 13

to more than 13

that much of 13

so in some 13
thinking of the 13

you have them 13
by a very 13
this is absolutely 13
to the national 13
way we look 13
through the whole 13
and the challenge 13
things we do 13
doing with the 13
computer - - 13
these things and 13
examples of what 13
from . but 13
that . . 13
we had . 13
sitting there in 13

this experiment . 13
that shows the 13

take <NUM> years 13
m not quite 13
but we actually 13
with the problem 13
this and we 13
as this . 13
the cost to 13
saw this , 13
do you take 13
than a million 13
, very low 13
the road and 13
poor countries , 13
of the economic 13
the 1990s . 13
try to change 13
, to use 13
some countries , 13
see there are 13
. or take 13
if you only 13
the most challenging 13
rely on the 13
by the world 13

that she has 13
the areas that 13

consistent with the 13
look on the 13
gave you a 13
very little , 13
but interestingly , 13
you had this 13
with the real 13
. things like 13
it made a 13
lot of sense 13
on this day 13
the government & 13
throughout all of 13
and if any 13
people look at 13
this and they 13
in the physical 13
of most of 13
the west and 13
people do , 13
, the media 13
who are interested 13
so , where 13

in and you 13
beginning . and 13
of mars , 13
is doing , 13
, it happened 13
things together . 13
t give them 13
, give them 13
that , all 13
was it ? 13
and i suddenly 13
pass it on 13
live . & 13
what you know 13
her name . 13
quite simple . 13
, the solution 13
next to it 13
the business model 13
s designed to 13
bit different . 13
a few moments 13
because ultimately , 13
and zeros . 13
our friends , 13
to convince them 13
every year for 13
it took them 13
you take all 13
do , like 13
high - powered 13
hope that i 13
time as a 13
company . it 13
of the girls 13
a space where 13
what type of 13

has a long 13
for this particular 13
sometime in the 13

the most extreme 13
being done in 13
this is us 13

poor people , 13
that time was 13
have you . 13
of change in 13
million people have 13
poor people are 13
and other parts 13

over , i 13
we got this 13
yet . & 13
s something in 13
that because i 13

instance , we 13
lots of money 13
down in a 13
and then take 13
same time we 13
be more like 13
through the process 13

we do for 12
first is the 12
when you first 12
this very moment 12
young people in 12

<NUM> people per 12
came home from 12
bit by bit 12

to hide . 12
good and bad 12
; the new 12

think and feel 12
who was one 12
: what would 12
old . so 12
learn so much 12
them to learn 12
we turn to 12
and at least 12
or maybe a 12
as being like 12
they go out 12
right , now 12
my lab and 12
experiments , and 12
. ag : 12
are actually more 12
t rely on 12
which i found 12
people think it 12
book . but 12
happen to the 12
the perception of 12
. i suppose 12
and then suddenly 12
upside - down 12
behind , and 12
ask people to 12
around in our 12
that people could 12
might be like 12
not how it 12
thought that it 12
ask me what 12
take about <NUM> 12
time , even 12
galaxies , and 12
in a million 12
announced that they 12
is awesome . 12
and we never 12
if we zoom 12
an area called 12
area called the 12
. so each 12
percent , but 12
got a good 12
bad , and 12
, right after 12
the train , 12
i was listening 12
me , like 12
look back , 12
start out with 12
performance , and 12
i just put 12
or are we 12
the greater good 12
; (laughter) if 12
just what we 12
t see what 12
what is really 12
. will you 12
s not for 12
months . this 12
s filled with 12
that . then 12
heart disease and 12
find a cure 12
things go wrong 12
do nothing . 12
and they live 12
the pharmaceutical industry 12
the late 1980s 12
she was one 12
that those are 12
. we always 12
think that one 12
go through . 12
and i hear 12
because it had 12
love them . 12
like new york 12
and then for 12
difference . but 12
city of new 12
to me on 12
are places where 12
has to take 12
line , the 12
homo sapiens , 12
extension of the 12
self , and 12
in a similar 12
; on a 12
those people in 12
of self , 12
the important point 12
of plants . 12
. now our 12
, the scientific 12
to humans . 12
are very close 12
s known as 12
and it gives 12
know what is 12
have , but 12
like me who 12
the country is 12
or non - 12
makes it possible 12
diversity in the 12
hard , because 12
this when i 12
time that they 12
to the kids 12
begin to understand 12
happened ? well 12
of the solutions 12
the solutions to 12
more of our 12
that the very 12
baby . and 12
, the social 12
to get things 12
want . they 12
to her that 12
long . so 12
, we bring 12
can see you 12
you . well 12
individuals who are 12
like myself , 12
you come into 12
something other than 12
on the x 12
x - axis 12
about the age 12
little bit in 12

of language , 12
language , the 12
move around , 12
do this to 12
translator : jenny 12
: would you 12
buildings . and 12
. so very 12
though , it 12
the start , 12
game - changing 12
as hard as 12
design and build 12
it to get 12
to save . 12
half of that 12
, combined with 12
at about the 12
and innovation . 12
them all together 12
, who used 12
; s cheaper 12
similarly , the 12
peer - reviewed 12
before you can 12
; re worth 12
do about the 12
with these things 12
it might not 12
and this means 12
we used it 12
and get out 12
like to point 12
is the u 12
have one , 12
of a mountain 12
so the real 12
parts . and 12
produce a lot 12
very simple and 12
and then look 12
a new product 12
are important to 12
could have done 12
by my side 12
and both of 12
that is when 12
could be as 12
t find any 12
opportunity to go 12
believe that our 12
look closely , 12
